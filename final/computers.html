<h1>Computers</h1>
<p>There are a vast of different types of computers these days.</p>
<h2>PC's</h2>
<p>They have a lot of programs and are widely used across the world.</p>
<h2>Mac's</h2>
<p>Have less programs but better ones.  Most pc lovers don't like them because they don't have games and that is what they are mainly interested in.  I guess they can stick to their <em>"blue screen of death."</em></p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>THe most stable and reliable but harder to use.</p>
